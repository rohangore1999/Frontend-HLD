# Frontend High-Level Design Implementations

This repository contains practical implementations of various real-world frontend high-level design concepts. Each subdirectory is a standalone demo that illustrates a specific architectural pattern, optimization technique, or design principle used in modern web development by Big Tech companies.

## What's Included

### [px-to-rem-demo](./px-to-rem-demo)

A demonstration of how to improve accessibility by automatically converting pixel values to rem units using Webpack and PostCSS. This implementation shows how to:

- Set up a build pipeline using Webpack
- Process CSS with PostCSS plugins
- Convert px units to rem for better scaling
- Implement font size controls that scale the entire UI

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

1. **Demonstrate Practical Implementations** - Show working examples of architectural patterns and not just theory
2. **Provide Reference Code** - Serve as a reference for implementing similar solutions in your own projects
3. **Showcase Best Practices** - Illustrate modern frontend development approaches with a focus on:
   - Accessibility
   - Performance optimization
   - Maintainable code structure
   - Modern build tooling

## How to Use This Repository

Each demo is a self-contained project with its own README, dependencies, and build process:

1. Navigate to the demo directory of interest
2. Read the specific README.md for context and instructions
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Follow the demo-specific instructions for running or building
